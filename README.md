## Project Proposal
The aim of our project is to explore machine learning processes used within the music industry. To do so, we use metrics taken from Spotify's API, directly and from a curated dataset from Kaggle.

Basing our training data off of a playlist made from among the class's favorite songs, we're able to get recommendations that fit into more specific criteria than the standard algorithm, as well as create visualizations representing the personalities of the tracks.
